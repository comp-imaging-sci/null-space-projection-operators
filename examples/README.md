## Description of Imaging Operators

`CRT_64_64_30_views.npz` and `RT_64x64_30_views.npz` are small-scale circular Radon transform and Radon transform imaging operators. These imaging operators were generated using [AIRToolsII](https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII).

## Description of Objects

`USCT_impedance_64x64.npy` is a 2D breast impedance map. To generate more objects, please see [usct-breast-phantom](https://github.com/comp-imaging-sci/usct-breast-phantom).
